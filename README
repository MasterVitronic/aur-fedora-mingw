Collection of PKGBUILDs for building mingw-64 packages
for archlinux. Think of it as an extension to AUR.

I needed a mingw environment to cross compile my GTK+3
applications for win32 and win64, but the default
PKGBUILDs provided by AUR were a mess. I decided to
build my own basing the scripts on the Fedora packages:

The following dependencies have been compiled directly
from AUR:

mingw-w64-binutils
mingw-w64-crt
mingw-w64-gcc
mingw-w64-gcc-base
mingw-w64-headers
mingw-w64-headers-bootstrap
mingw-w64-libpng
mingw-w64-libxml2
mingw-w64-pkg-config
mingw-w64-tools
mingw-w64-winpthreads
mingw-w64-zlib
